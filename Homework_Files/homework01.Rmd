At this point, if the class has been a smooth sail for you, you should be able to pull the repository into RStudio, edit the README.md file using RStudio editor, and push it back to the repository. 

You may alternatively edit the file in GitHub browser. Try it out.

This is the assignment. Edit README.md file by pulling into RStudio, editing, saving and pushing it. Also, edit the file in Github browser. Be creative.

##### Report how you did it? - we really care for you

Write a description in README.md how you got the changes.

1. What changes you made using the Github browser?

2. What changes you made using RStudio - by editing locally, saving, commiting, and pushing to github.com?

Feel free to write how this exercise worked for you and other things you read (related to this course).
