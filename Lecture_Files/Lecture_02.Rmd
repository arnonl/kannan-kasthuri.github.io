### Lecture 02 (Sept. 12, 2017)

#### R/RStudio Basics 

Launch RStudio. By default the panes should look something like this -

Note that you can [customize](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-RStudio) all of them. Initially we will be primarily working with the console before moving to the editor.

#### Assignments 

Assignments are of the form:

```{r eval=FALSE} 
  Object <- Object_Value
```

which can be construed to express "object gets the object's value".

For instance,

```{r eval=TRUE}
  x <- 5+13
  x
```

will reveal _object x gets the value 18_. The double hash `##` is the result as it should appear in your console.

We will be using lots of assignments. While `=` sign will equally work for assignments, it is best to use `<-` as this will avoid lots of confusion later on. If you are lazy to use `<-` note that RStudio provides lots of shortcut options. For instance, the assignment operator `<-` has shortcut `Option+-` in Mac and `Alt+-` in windows. For a comprehensive list of shortcuts, refer to the list [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts). Moreover, `Option+Shift+k` (in Mac) in RStudio will bring keyboard shortcut reference card. 

**Tip**: Note that RStudio automatically surrounds assignment operator with spaces. It is a good coding practice to allow spaces to enhance readability.

_Caveat_: Objects cannot start with certain charecters (such as comma, space), or start with numbers. [Snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) and [Camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) are a good practices for naming conventions.

##### Be careful of what you type

Whatever convention you prefer, maintain consistency. Consistancy and accuracy are critical when dealing with computers and programming. Whenever you run into errors the first thing you check are the typos. Case matters, typos matter. In my experience, I have found almost all the errors made by beginners are attributed to typographical errors. There is no other way than getting better at typing and checking/re-checking.

You can assign strings to objects using qutation marks. For example, the following code assigns the string "R rocks" to the object _r_.

```{r eval=TRUE}
  r <- "R rocks"
  r
```


**Classwork**: Assign the string _hello world_ to the object _h_ and print the result.

#### Functions

R has a wide-range of built-in functions that are generally of the form:

```{r eval=FALSE}
  functionName(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, and so on)
```

**Note**: Not all functions will have arguments. For instance, the function `date()` that prints the current date and time does not have any argument.

```{r eval=TRUE}
  date()
```

One of the extremely helpful feature of RStudio is the `?` operator. You can use this to find out the description of the function in question, including its usage and arguments. <span style="color:blue"> _Question the function to know more about the function in question_. </span> For instance,

```{r eval=FALSE}
  ?date()
```

would describe the function `date()` in the help tab of the IDE.

**Tip**: If you type `da` in console and hit TAB, RStudio will try to autocomplete the function for you, suggesting hints on what possibly could be the built-in function. Also, if you type an open paranthesis, RStudio will also supply the closed parathesis.

Note that if you type the function name without any paranthesis, R will print the source code of the function, which is not you may probably want.

**Classwork**: Consider the `seq` function. What does it do?
