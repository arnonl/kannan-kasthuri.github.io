### An Introduction to Linear Algebra (Sept. 27, 2017)

_There is hardly any theory which is more elementary than linear algebra, in spite of the fact that generations of professors and textbook writers have obscured its simplicity by preposterous calculations with matrices_. - Jean Dieudonn√© (1906-1992)

#### Essence of linear algebra

Linear algebra is required knowledge for any technical discipline: Computer science, Physics, Electrical engineering, Mechanical engineering, Statistics etc. -although it is poorly understood by students. We probably would have learned so many (crazy) things like,

$$ A \times B= \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
    a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
    a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}  \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    b_{11} & b_{12} & b_{13} \\
    b_{21} & b_{22} & b_{23} \\
    b_{31} & b_{32} & b_{33}  \\
\end{bmatrix}= 
$$
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11}b_{11}+a_{11}b_{21}+a_{11}b_{31} & a_{12}b_{12}+a_{12}b_{22}+a_{12}b_{32} & a_{13}b_{13}+a_{13}b_{23}+a_{12}b_{33} \\
    a_{21}b_{11}+a_{21}b_{21}+a_{21}b_{31} & a_{22}b_{12}+a_{22}b_{22}+a_{22}b_{32} & a_{23}b_{13}+a_{23}b_{23}+a_{23}b_{33} \\
    a_{31}b_{11}+a_{31}b_{21}+a_{31}b_{31} & a_{32}b_{12}+a_{32}b_{22}+a_{32}b_{32} & a_{33}b_{13}+a_{33}b_{23}+a_{33}b_{33} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
or determinant

$$ det(A)= 
\begin{vmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_{12} \\
    a_{21} & a_{22}\\
\end{vmatrix} = a_{11}a_{22}-a_{12}a_{21}
$$
or cross products,

$$ v \times u= 
det\begin{vmatrix}
    \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k}\\
    v_{1} & v_{2} & v_{3} \\
    u_{1} & u_{2} & u_{3}
\end{vmatrix} 
$$

or eigenvalues,

$$ det(A-\lambda I) = 0$$

But they might really come out without understanding why they are defined the way they are. We are vaguely aware of the geometric intuition behind such definitions. Numeric and geometric understanding differ fundementally. While numeric understanding allows us to do actual computations, geometric understanding is helpful for:

* judging what tools are useful for what problems, 
* feel the problem and 
* know how to interpret the results.

Without geometric understaning, professors teaching applications look like wizzards and linear algebra looks intimidating!

For example, if you are taught from your young age that `sin` function is:

$$ sin(x) = x-\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}+\dots+(-1)^{n}\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}+\dots$$
and vaguely know it is related to triangles. If you are sitting in a physics class learning trajectories, it may seem magical.

Luckily, linear algebra is not too different! There are **visual** intuitions underlying the subject. And unlike the above `sin` example, the visual intuitions are much straight forward and lot of what it has been taught in a numeric way will sound more reasonable. In fairness, many professors will make an attempt to convey the geometric understanding, but lots of courses spend disproportinate amount of time in numerical side of things, especially in this day and age where numerical computations can be left to computers and we focussing on conceptual ideas. In the following sections, we will try to understand the basics of linear algebra through geometric intuition.

#### Vectors: What even are they?

_The introduction of numbers as coordinates is an act of violence_ - Hermann Weyl

Vectors are seen differently by different folks.

* Physics student perspective: Magnitude and direction. Coordinate free. Eg., _force_.

* CS student perspective: Ordered lists of numbers. Model using array of numbers where order matters. In R programming it is essentially a list with same data type.

* Math student perspective: Tries to generalize both these views. A vector can be anything as long as we can add two vectors or multiply a vector with a scalar.

The later view comes from the fact that addition and scalar multiplication is extremely useful throughout linear algebra. In math, we always think a vector is rooted in some origin. In two dimensions, every pair of numbers is associated with only one vector and every vector is associated with only one pair of numbers.

##### Vector addition

Vector addition is an extension of 1-d addition.

In general, 

$$  
\begin{bmatrix}
    x_1 \\
    y_1 \\
\end{bmatrix}  +
\begin{bmatrix}
    x_2 \\
    y_2 \\
\end{bmatrix}  =
\begin{bmatrix}
    x_1+x_2 \\
    y_1+y_2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

##### Scalar multiplication

Scaling a vector by a constant expands or squishes it by the factor it is scaled,

At the end of the day, it doesn't matter if you think vectors as fundamentally arrows in space (physcists view) with numbers associated to them or lists of numbers (computer scientists view) with arrows associated with them, the usefullness of linear algebra lies in the fact that these notions are interchangeable. This gives data scientits to conceptualize numbers in a visual way (like PCA) that identifies patterns in data and gives a global view of what certain operations do. On the other hand it gives physicists and graphics programmers a language to describe and manipulate space that can be crunched and run in a computer.
