### Data science fundamentals 04: Exploratory data analysis (Oct. 03, 2017)

---

This is the concluding part of EDA workshop. Import the data set and change data types to reflect their correct annotation (housekeeping).


```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
  # Load the package RCurl
  library(RCurl)
  # Import the HANES data set from GitHub; break the string into two for readability
  # (Please note this readability aspect very carefully)
  URL_text_1 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kannan-kasthuri/kannan-kasthuri.github.io"
  URL_text_2 <- "/master/Datasets/HANES/NYC_HANES_DIAB.csv"
  # Paste it to constitute a single URL 
  URL <- paste(URL_text_1,URL_text_2, sep="")
  HANES <- read.csv(text=getURL(URL))
  # Rename the GENDER factor for identification
  HANES$GENDER <- factor(HANES$GENDER, labels=c("M","F"))
  # Rename the AGEGROUP factor for identification
  HANES$AGEGROUP <- factor(HANES$AGEGROUP, labels=c("20-39","40-59","60+"))
  # Rename the HSQ_1 factor for identification
  HANES$HSQ_1 <- factor(HANES$HSQ_1, labels=c("Excellent","Very Good","Good", "Fair", "Poor"))
  # Rename the DX_DBTS as a factor
  HANES$DX_DBTS <- factor(HANES$DX_DBTS, labels=c("DIAB","DIAB NO_DX","NO DIAB"))
  # Omit all NA from the data frame
  HANES <- na.omit(HANES)
  # Observe the structure
  str(HANES)
  # Load the tidyverse library
  library(tidyverse)
```


#### Missing values

It may be tempting to ignore unsual values, but it is best to replace unusual values by `NA`. This can be done by `ifelse()` function:

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, na.rm=FALSE}
  # Input HANSES
  HANES_repl_unusual <- HANES %>% 
  # Replace using ifelse
  mutate(CREATININE = ifelse(CREATININE <= 0.42 & CREATININE > 0.375, NA, CREATININE))
```
  
```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
  # Input HANSES
  HANES_repl_unusual <- HANES %>% 
  # Replace using ifelse
  mutate(CREATININE = ifelse(CREATININE <= 0.42 & CREATININE > 0.375, NA, CREATININE))
```

`ifelse()` has three arguments. The first argument test should be a logical vector. The result will contain the value of the second argument, yes, when test is TRUE, and the value of the third argument, no, when it is false.

Sometimes `NA` could just mean no other option which we may want to compare with the rest of the options. For example, the HANES data set was collected at different times. Some of them who did not have their A1C levels measured may have GLUCOSE levels measured. We may want to compare, say, GLUCOSE levels of people with no A1C information with the levels for the people with A1C information. 

[Since we omited `NA` from HANES, we will re-import the data set]:

```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Load the package RCurl
  library(RCurl)
  # Import the HANES data set from GitHub; break the string into two for readability
  # (Please note this readability aspect very carefully)
  URL_text_1 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kannan-kasthuri/kannan-kasthuri.github.io"
  URL_text_2 <- "/master/Datasets/HANES/HANES.original.csv"
  # Paste it to constitute a single URL 
  URL <- paste(URL_text_1,URL_text_2, sep="")
  HANES_with_NA <- read.csv(text=getURL(URL))
```

And here is the code to do this -

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
  # From the HANES_with_NA dataset
  HANES_with_NA %>% 
  # Find the glucose levels of people with no A1C through the
  # logical operator/function is.na()
  mutate(no_A1C = is.na(A1C),
         glucose_level = GLUCOSE) %>% 
  # Now plot the result for the logical categories
  ggplot(mapping = aes(glucose_level)) + 
    geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(colour = no_A1C), binwidth = 1/4)
```

```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
  # From the HANES_with_NA dataset
  HANES_with_NA %>% 
  # Find the glucose levels of people with no A1C through the
  # logical operator/function is.na()
  mutate(no_A1C = is.na(A1C),
         glucose_level = GLUCOSE) %>% 
  # Now plot the result for the logical categories
  ggplot(mapping = aes(glucose_level)) + 
    geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(colour = no_A1C), binwidth = 1/4)
```

We immediately infer that there are only a few such cases (to our delight)!

#### Covariation

Variation describes the behavior within a variable, covariation describes the behavior between variables. 

Covariation is the tendency for the values of two or more variables to vary together in a related way. 

The best way to spot covariation is to visualise the relationship between two or more variables. 

First we will consider the variation between continous and categorical variables.

##### Variation between continous and categorical variable

One can plot the frequency distribution between continious and categorical variable. For example, in the HANES data set, let us plot the frequency distribution of mercury in urine (MERCURYU variable) for different age groups. 

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
  # Plot the frequency distribution of mercury for different age groups
  ggplot(data = HANES, mapping = aes(x = MERCURYU)) + 
    geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(colour = AGEGROUP), binwidth = 1)
```
  
```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
  # Plot the frequency distribution of mercury for different age groups
  ggplot(data = HANES, mapping = aes(x = MERCURYU)) + 
    geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(colour = AGEGROUP), binwidth = 1)
```

This plot that says people in age groups 20-39 is the largest group with average mercury in urine, followed by age group 40-59 and then by 60+, is misleading because the number of people in the group might differ. 

This is the case as we can see:

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
  # Find the distribution of people in each age group
  ggplot(HANES) + 
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = AGEGROUP))
```
  
```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
  # Find the distribution of people in each age group
  ggplot(HANES) + 
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = AGEGROUP))
```

Number of people in 20-39 > # of people in 40-59 > # of people in 60+. 

To make the comparison easier we need to swap what is displayed on the y-axis. 

Instead of displaying count, weâ€™ll display **density**, which is the count standardised so that the area under each frequency polygon is one.

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
  # Plot density instead of count for MERCURYU variable
  ggplot(data = HANES, mapping = aes(x = MERCURYU, y = ..density..)) + 
    geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(colour = AGEGROUP), binwidth = 1)
```
  
```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
  # Plot density instead of count for MERCURYU variable
  ggplot(data = HANES, mapping = aes(x = MERCURYU, y = ..density..)) + 
    geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(colour = AGEGROUP), binwidth = 1)
```

We can right away see that all groups have equal number of people with average mercury-in-urine levels. In contrast, if we plot the density of blood hemoglobin (A1C) levels for these age groups, we see: 

```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
  # Plot density instead of count for A1C variable
  ggplot(data = HANES, mapping = aes(x = A1C, y = ..density..)) + 
    geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(colour = AGEGROUP), binwidth = 1)
```

the group 20-39 has the smallest variation in blood hemoglobin levels.


Another alternative to display the distribution of a continuous variable broken down by a categorical variable is the **boxplot**. A boxplot is a type of visual shorthand for a distribution of values that is popular among statisticians. Each boxplot consists of:

* A box that stretches from the 25th percentile of the distribution to the 75th percentile, a distance known as the interquartile range (IQR). In the middle of the box is a line that displays the median, i.e. 50th percentile, of the distribution. These three lines give you a sense of the spread of the distribution and whether or not the distribution is symmetric about the median or skewed to one side.

* Visual points that display observations that fall more than 1.5 times the IQR from either edge of the box. These outlying points are unusual so are plotted individually.

* A line (or whisker) that extends from each end of the box and goes to the farthest non-outlier point in the distribution.

We can look at the variation between A1C and AGEGROUP through a box plot.

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
  # Make a box plot for A1C and AGEGROUP
  ggplot(data = HANES, mapping = aes(x = AGEGROUP, y = A1C)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```
  
```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
  # Make a box plot for A1C and AGEGROUP
  ggplot(data = HANES, mapping = aes(x = AGEGROUP, y = A1C)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

Thus the box plot confirms our observation that the group 20-39 has the smallest variation in blood hemoglobin levels. AGEGROUP is an ordinal (meaning which can be ordered). Some categorical variables such as health status (HSQ_1) cannot be ordered and understanding the trend might be difficult. 

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
  # Make a box plot for HDL and HSQ_1
  ggplot(data = HANES, mapping = aes(x = HSQ_1, y = HDL)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
  # Make a box plot for HDL and HSQ_1
  ggplot(data = HANES, mapping = aes(x = HSQ_1, y = HDL)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

For such comparisons we can make use of `reorder` argument, say, based on median:

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
  # Make a box plot for HDL and HSQ_1 based on reordering by median values
  ggplot(data = HANES, mapping = aes(x = reorder(HSQ_1, HDL, FUN = median), y = HDL)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
  # Make a box plot for HDL and HSQ_1 based on reordering by median values
  ggplot(data = HANES, mapping = aes(x = reorder(HSQ_1, HDL, FUN = median), y = HDL)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

Such reordering helps us to see that average HDL increases as the health status becomes better.

If we have long variable names, `geom_boxplot()` will work better if you flip it 90Â°. You can do that with `coord_flip()`.

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
  # Make a box plot for HDL and HSQ_1 based on reordering by median values
  # and flip coordinates
  ggplot(data = HANES, mapping = aes(x = reorder(HSQ_1, HDL, FUN = median), y = HDL)) +
    geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()
```

```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
  # Make a box plot for HDL and HSQ_1 based on reordering by median values
  # and flip coordinates
  ggplot(data = HANES, mapping = aes(x = reorder(HSQ_1, HDL, FUN = median), y = HDL)) +
    geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()
```
