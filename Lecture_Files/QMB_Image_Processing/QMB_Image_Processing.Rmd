#### Digital image fundamentals

The term image refers to a 2D light-intensity function denoted by $f(x,y)$, where the value or amplitude of $f$ at spatial coordinates $(x,y)$ gives the intensity (brightness) of the image at that point.

The basic nature of $f(x,y)$ can be characterised by two components:

1. The amount of source light incident (_illumination_) on the scene:

$$
i(x,y) \text{ where } 0\leq i(x,y) \leq \infty
$$

2. The amount of light reflected (_reflectance_) by the objects:

$$
r(x,y) \text{ where } 0\leq r(x,y) \leq 1
$$

Total absorption $r(x,y) = 0$ and $r(x,y) = 1$ is never acheived.

The functions $i(x,y)$ and $r(x,y)$ combine as a product:

$$
f(x,y) = i(x,y)r(x,y) \text{ and hence } 0 \leq f(x,y) \leq \infty
$$

In order for a computer to process an image, it has to be described as a series of numbers, each of finite precision. The digitisation of $f(x,y)$ is called:

1. **Image sampling** when it refers to spatial coordinates $(x,y)$ and

2. **Quantisation** when it refers to the amplitude of $f(x,y)$

The images are thus only sampled at a discrete number of locations with a discrete set of brightness levels.

The following is the height profile of Switzerland and sub-sampled height profile of Swiss.

Similarly, we can quantize the intensity along the red line:

to get the quantized version,

When considered together, the digitization process requires making decision about:

- the size of the image array $N\times M$ and

- the number of discrete grey-levels $G$ allowed for each pixel, $f(x,y)$

In digital image processing these quantities are usually powers of two, thus,

$N = 2^n$, $M = 2^m$ and $G = 2^k$ for some $n, m \text{ and } k$.

How many samples and grey-levels are required for a good approximation?

- **resolution** (degree of discernable detail) of an image depends on the number of samples and grey-levels

- the bigger these parameters, the closer the digitised array approximates the original image

- however, the storage and processing time increases rapidly

##### Relationship between the pixels

Quantisation alone does not imply a spatial structure â†’ it must be defined

We have to consider topology and metrics

Neighborhood is defined via metrics and vice-versa and are defined on the grid

In 2D they are defined as 4-, 8- or mixed-neighbourhoods. We will see them now.

But before that we will define the following:

Digital image is denoted by $f(x,y)$, pixels as $p,q$ and subset of pixels of $f(x,y)$ as $S$
