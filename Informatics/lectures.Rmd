<center> <h3>Welcome to my collected informatics works</h3> </center>

Over the past few months I had a good opportunity to direct and teach courses in informatics. Isn't it a good idea to compile and have them in a central location for easier access and information? Almost all (except for one or two) have video recordings. So, feel free to browse the series and in case you spot any errors (both of omission and commission), please feel free to report. I can be approached at my first name at gmail dot com.

If you need more information about the course content, like homeworks, projects etc., you can look into the course home pages which can be accessed from my  [teaching](https://kannan-kasthuri.github.io/Teaching/teaching.html) page.

**A Note:** Although I have separate sections on informatics topics, I don't mean to distinguish data science from other topics. To be a good data scientist, several aspects of informatics are necessary, including linear algebra, statistics, signal/image processing etc. Therefore, this entire collection should come under the ambit of data science. This is precisely the reason why topics such as algorithms, optimization, linear algebra etc., follow data science series and I will use these words interchangeably.

Why data science now? After all data analysis has been there from the days of Galileo when he measured gravity. And the normal distribution was discovered by Carl Fredrich Gauss in $1809$. So to see why data science is more useful now, you may want to watch the following stream.
