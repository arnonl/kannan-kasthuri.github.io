<center> <h3>Welcome to my collected informatics works</h3> </center>

---

Over the past few months I had a good opportunity to direct and teach courses in informatics. Isn't it a good idea to compile and have them in a central location for easier access and information? Almost all lectures have video recordings, except for one or two. So, feel free to browse the series and in case you spot any errors (both of omission and commission), please feel free to report. You can contact me at _my first name_ at _gmail_ dot _com_

If you need more information about the course content, like homeworks, projects etc., you can look into the course home pages which can be accessed from my  [teaching](https://kannan-kasthuri.github.io/Teaching/teaching.html) page.

**A Note:** Although I have separate sections which probably would come under the broad theme of informatics, I don't mean to distinguish data science from informatics. To be a good data scientist, several topics in informatics are necessary, including linear algebra, statistics, signal/image processing etc. Therefore, this entire collection should come under the ambit of data science (and even more such as machine learning that I currently don't have). This is precisely the reason why the page is named "Data Science" and topics such as programming fundamentals, algorithms, optimization, linear algebra etc., have data science series. I will use the words "informatics" and "data science" interchangeably.

Why data science now? After all data analysis has been there from the days of Galileo when he measured gravity. Talking about statistics, the normal distribution was discovered by Carl Fredrich Gauss in $1809$. To see why data science is more useful now, you may want to watch the [introductory lecture](https://kannan-kasthuri.github.io/Lecture_Files/PDA_Lecture_01/Lecture_01.html) in my course. 

If you are seriously pursuing data science, it goes without saying that it will be extremely useful to learn Git. If you don't have the time to learn advanced stuffs, get the basic operations working, like, push, pull and commits. Remember, learning Git is an investment and you will be attractive to future employers.

[Data Science 01](https://kannan-kasthuri.github.io/Informatics/DS01/DS01.html): In this lecture we introduce the basics of R programming language and introduce key concepts. Most of the time as you import data sets in R, by default, R would convert some of the factor variables into basic data types, and therefore it is important to know the underlying idea behind this such as coercion which are covered here.

[Data Science 02](https://kannan-kasthuri.github.io/Informatics/DS02/DS02.html): Linked lists form the heart of R programming language. Data frames are constructed out of lists. We study lists and basic graphics. Although `ggplot` is a better framework for plots in R, knowing basic plots is important to better appreciate the plots produced through grammar of graphics. These are presented here.

[Data Science 03](https://kannan-kasthuri.github.io/Informatics/DS03/DS03.html): This topic starts with defining conditional statements in R, functions and scope. More importantly, we introduce R markdown. Communcation and reproducability are cornerstones of science and analysis. R markdown is an excellent framework for these. It is pretty easy to get going with `Rmd`. Check it out -
