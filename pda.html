        <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
        <p>Towards the end of this course the student will exhibit in-depth understanding of data science and analysis methods as well as proficiency in R. The student will produce a portfolio of data analysis projects from the course that demonstrates mastery of analysis and visualization methods. He /She will be equipped for analysis of biomedical and genomic data sets. Another main objective of the course is to communicate statistical results correctly and effectively.</p>

        <h3>Course Overview</h3>
        <p>This course is designed to empower students to learn R programming language to conduct data science. We will study a wide range of topics, including, handing and querying databases, exploratory/confirmatory analysis and visualization in R. We will closely follow the book R for Data Science, however the emphasis will be given to working with biomedical data than datasets illustrated and used in the textbook.
        <br> This course does <b> not </b> have any pre-requisites.</p>

        <h3>General Policies</h3>

        <p>Late/missed work: You must adhere to the due dates for all required submissions. If you miss a deadline, then you will not get credit for that assignment/post. <br>

          Incompletes: No "Incompletes" will be assigned for this course unless we are at the very end of the course and you have an emergency. <br>

          Responding to Messages: I will check e-mails daily during the week, and I will respond to course related questions within 48 hours. <br>

          Announcements: I will make announcements throughout the semester by e-mail. <br>

          Make sure that your email address is updated; otherwise you may miss important emails from me. <br>

          Safeguards: Always back up your work on a safe place (electronic file with a backup is recommended) and make a hard copy. Do not wait for the last minute to do your work. Allow time for deadlines. <br>

          Plagiarism: Plagiarism, the presentation of someone else's words or ideas as your own, is a serious offense and will not be tolerated in this class. The first time you plagiarize someone else's work, you will receive a zero for that assignment. The second time you plagiarize, you will fail the course with a notation of academic dishonesty on your official record.</p>
